# CubeSat System Model

This is an semi-complex CubeSat system model which can be used for theoretical mission proposal. 

The file "main.m" is the entry point into the script whilst "conditions.m" is where the parameters can be adjusted. 

Note: There may be errors in these calculations and I do not accept any liability for how they are used
