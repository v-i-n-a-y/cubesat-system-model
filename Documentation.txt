Assignment: A3

This script is meant to act as a system model for a cubesat. Its input 
system is dynamic allowing it to read data from in script or from an excel
spreadsheet separate to the matlab script. 

* Note: As of writing this there is not implementation of reading that from
        an excel sheet. 
It also implements three ways in which orbit elements can be read into the 
script. This is defined using the 'flag_orbit_data' in the conditions file
for incscript definition of variables. 

    1 - Read from script
    2 - Read from script defined tle
    3 - Read tle from server (blank, has to be setup accordingly)

The script operate in discreet interconnected bubbles of code all working 
from the script main which is called when conditions is ran. The conditions
file also acts as the input page.
